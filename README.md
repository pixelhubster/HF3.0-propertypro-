##DAO Property Selling Platform
Welcome to the DAO Property Selling Platform! This project is a decentralized application (dApp) that leverages blockchain technology and ReactJS to create a novel property investment platform. The system enables users to invest in real estate by purchasing shares of a property and participating in its management through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model.

##Overview
This platform allows users to:

Buy Shares of Property: Invest in real estate by purchasing fractional ownership in a property. Each share represents a portion of ownership and potential return on investment.
Participate in Decision-Making: Engage in the management of the property through a DAO, where decisions are made collectively by shareholders. This includes decisions on property management, improvements, and other key aspects.
Access Property Chat: Communicate with other shareholders and manage discussions related to the property through an integrated chat feature.

##Features
Blockchain Integration: Utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to ensure secure, transparent transactions and governance. Ownership and voting rights are recorded on the blockchain.
ReactJS Front-End: Provides a responsive and intuitive user interface for interacting with the platform, managing investments, and participating in governance.
DAO Governance: Implemented using smart contracts to facilitate decentralized decision-making, allowing stakeholders to vote on key issues and property management decisions.
Property Chat: Real-time chat functionality to foster communication among investors and stakeholders.

##Technologies
Frontend: ReactJS, TailwindCSS for styling, and TypeScript for robust type checking.
Backend: Ethereum smart contracts for DAO governance and property transactions.
Database: MongoDB for managing user data and property information.

##Usage
Invest in Property: Navigate to the investment page, select a property, and purchase shares.
Participate in Governance: Access the DAO interface to vote on proposals and make decisions.
Chat with Other Investors: Use the chat feature to discuss property-related matters and share insights.
