# DAO Property Selling Platform

Welcome to the **DAO Property Selling Platform**! This project is a decentralized application (dApp) that combines blockchain technology and ReactJS to offer a unique property investment experience. 

## Overview

This platform allows users to:
- **Buy Shares of Property:** Invest in real estate by purchasing fractional ownership in properties. Each share represents a portion of ownership and potential return on investment.
- **Participate in Decision-Making:** Engage in the management of the property through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model. Shareholders collectively make decisions on property management and improvements.
- **Access Property Chat:** Communicate with other shareholders and manage discussions related to the property through an integrated chat feature.

## Features

- **Blockchain Integration:** Utilizes Ethereum smart contracts for secure, transparent transactions and governance. Ownership and voting rights are recorded on the blockchain.
- **ReactJS Front-End:** Provides a responsive and intuitive user interface for interacting with the platform, managing investments, and participating in governance.
- **DAO Governance:** Implemented using smart contracts to facilitate decentralized decision-making, allowing stakeholders to vote on proposals and property management decisions.
- **Property Chat:** Real-time chat functionality to foster communication among investors and stakeholders.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Ethereum smart contracts for DAO governance and property transactions
